# SmileChain üòÑ‚õìÔ∏è

**SmileChain** is a MERN + Web3-based decentralized application that rewards users for their smiles. Leveraging AI and
blockchain technology, SmileChain creates a unique and fun way to interact with Ethereum transactions while promoting
positivity.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **AI-Powered Smile Detection**: Utilizes the [FaceAPI](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) model to
  detect smiles.
- **Decentralized Rewards System**: Implements Ethereum smart contracts (via Solidity) to award 0.01 Ether for smiles
  with a score above 60%.
- **Robust User Authentication**: Ensures secure tracking of users with login and session management.
- **Interactive Gallery**: Displays all rewarded pictures in a gallery where logged-in users can view and like images,
  promoting engagement.
- **Seamless Frontend**: Built with React for an intuitive user interface.
- **Robust Backend**: Node.js and Express handle the application logic.
- **Efficient Storage**: MongoDB is used to store user data, transaction logs, and gallery interactions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Interacts with the Ethereum network using Truffle and Ganache for testing.

## üì∏ How It Works

1. **Smile Detection**:
    - The app uses your webcam to analyze your smile using the FaceAPI model.
    - A "smiling score" is calculated in real-time.

2. **Blockchain Interaction**:
    - If the smiling score exceeds **60%**, a request is sent to the Ethereum blockchain.
    - A Solidity smart contract verifies the transaction and awards **0.01 Ether** to your account.

3. **Gallery of Awarded Pictures**:
    - Successfully rewarded smiles are saved and displayed in a public gallery.
    - Logged-in users can browse the gallery, like their favorite smiles, and interact with others.

4. **Transaction Logging**:
    - User data and transaction details are securely stored in a MongoDB database for tracking.

5. **User Authentication**:
    - Robust user authentication ensures secure access to the platform.
    - Each user has a unique account to maintain accurate records of smiles, rewards, and interactions.
