# SmileChain üòÑ‚õìÔ∏è

**SmileChain** is a MERN + Web3-based decentralized application that rewards users for their smiles. Leveraging AI and
blockchain technology, SmileChain provides a unique and engaging experience by turning smiles into valuable rewards, all
while promoting positivity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **AI-Powered Smile Detection**: Detects smiles using the [FaceAPI](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js)
  model.
- **Reward Point System**: Users earn reward points for smiles with a score greater than **0.60**, which can be
  accumulated for future redemptions.
- **Reward Exchange Options**: Redeem points for Ether, gift cards, or exclusive coupons.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage reward settings, transaction delays, and reward exchange options.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Ensures secure tracking of users with login and session management.
- **Interactive Gallery**: Displays rewarded smile pictures in a gallery where users can engage by viewing and liking
  them.
- **Efficient Data Storage**: MongoDB securely stores user information, transaction logs, and gallery interactions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Interacts with the Ethereum network using Truffle and Ganache for testing.

## üì∏ How It Works

### **Smile Detection**

- The app uses your webcam to detect smiles in real-time with the FaceAPI model.
- A "smiling score" is calculated, measuring the intensity and quality of the smile.

### **Reward Point System**

- Smiles with a score greater than **0.60** earn reward points for the user.
- Points are stored in the user's account for future redemptions.

### **Reward Exchange Options**

- Accumulated reward points can be redeemed for:
    - **Ether:** Exchange points via smart contracts.
    - **Gift Cards:** Use points to access exclusive deals and discounts.
    - **Coupons:** Redeem points for special offers.

### **Admin Panel for Reward Management**

- The admin panel provides the following controls:
    - Configure the reward points granted per successful smile.
    - Set a cooldown period between consecutive reward point claims.
    - Manage reward exchange options by adding, deleting, or modifying available rewards.

### **Interactive Gallery**

- Successfully rewarded smiles are saved and displayed in a public gallery.
- Logged-in users can browse, like their favorite smiles, and engage with others.

# üõ°Ô∏è Smart Contract

The Ethereum smart contract handles:

- **Transparent Reward Distribution:** Ensure that reward points are awarded fairly and accurately based on user
  interactions.
- **Secure Point Exchange Management:** Safeguard the process of exchanging reward points for Ether, gift cards, or
  coupons.
- **Comprehensive Transaction History:** Maintain a detailed and transparent record of all reward and transaction
  activities for audit and user reference.
- **Scalable Smart Contract Design:** Enable easy updates and scalability for future reward mechanisms or additional
  features.
- **Automated Reward Redemption:** Handle the seamless processing of reward redemptions based on smart contract logic.
- **Anti-Fraud Measures:** Implement safeguards to prevent fraudulent claims and unauthorized transactions.
- **User Notifications:** Provide real-time notifications for successful smile detections, point awards, and reward
  redemptions.
- **Flexible Reward Policy Configuration:** Allow dynamic changes to reward criteria and redemption options through the
  admin panel.
